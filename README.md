This repo holds multiple different image tools.
- Image Denoise:
    A python wrapper around (AI) denoisers. Currently this only wraps Intels OpenImageDenoise (https://github.com/OpenImageDenoise/oidn). See the build.sh file for build instructions as well as the denoiseEnginesExample.py file on instructions how to run a denoise on numpy pixel arrays (The example uses OpenImageIO (https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio) to get/set the pixels and to read/write the image).

Install instructions:
- Follow the instructions in the install.md file (Only tested on Linux, should be the same for Windows though).

This repo is still under construction, code is provided as is with no support :)
